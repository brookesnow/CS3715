students and/or campuses. Our website also allows the user to get directions from MUN to a selected few landmarks around St.Johns
Including: 
		Mun Botanical Gardens
		Bannerman Park
		Signal Hill

We also allow the user to update and submit new information regarding new events and campus information to the main page.
